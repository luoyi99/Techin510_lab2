# Techin 510 Lab 2
Scrape https://visitseattle.org for events happening in Seattle and look up the weather of the date of the event.

The **event_list.cvs** file will contain all the events happening in Seattle, and the **event_weather_info.cvs** file will contain the weather information of the event happens in 7 days.

*NOTE: Ongoing events as well as events that last multiple days will not be included in the event_weather_info.cvs file.*
